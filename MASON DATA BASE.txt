 Over the time our CEO has ran his marketing agency, hes studied the algorithms of what works and what doesn’t, what grabs attention and what takes that attention and turns it into profit, and he has worked with some of the biggest social media marketing teams to create an algorithm we used to train our software to know exactly what will make your program successful.
